        """Sync webhooks between local database and Trello.

        The syncing process is bidirectional - you may have webhooks registered
        with Trello that are not in the local database, and you may also
        webhooks in the local database that are not registered with Trello.

        Webhooks are registered in Trello against a combination of the Trello
        model id and a user token. The `list_hooks` API call requires a user
        token, and this _may_ be supplied as a command option (--token, -t).

        Alternatively, any tokens that are in the local database are also used,
        when calling `list_hooks`.

        The logic works like this:

        1. Sync all local webhooks to Trello
        2. Fetch all remote webhooks, using all available tokens
        3. Save any remote webhooks not already stored locally

        At this point you should have the same webhooks locally and remotely.
        Any further edits (e.g. deletion) can be made from the admin site.
