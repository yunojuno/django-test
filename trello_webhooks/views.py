    """Handle the callback from Trello.

    Callbacks come in two flavours - a HEAD request is the initial
    activation check from Trello - we can ignore that and simply respond
    with a 200. A POST request is an event - with the event payload as per
    the API docs.

    New callback events are stored locally, and then the django signal
    is sent so that client apps can handle the event.

    NB This is all happening synchronously whilst Trello is waiting for a
    response from the view, so don't have long-running processes handling
    the signal.

    Args:
        auth_token: string, the user token against which the webhook was
            registered.
        trello_model_id: string, the model id - which was registered with
            Trello initially. This is the object that has generated the
            callback.
